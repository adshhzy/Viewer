# Viewer

This viewer is used for visualizing the multi-labeled surface (.suf).

The viewer requires QT and Eigen3. Please build the program by openning the .pro file in QT. Please also specify the include directory of Eigen3 in the .pro file.

Pless the LoadContour button for loading and visualizing .contour files

Pless the LoadSuf button for loading and visualizing *.suf, *.obj, *.off  files.

Pless the LoadTopo button, and select the folder that contains the three folders (cross-section, meta, suf) for loading and visualizing the result generated by the following program:

https://github.com/adshhzy/Multitopo

When you visualizing the multi-labeled surface (.suf), you can slide the label slider to visualize surface of different labels (maniford surfaces). When the slider get to -1 (leftmost), you will see the non-maniford surface network that divided the space into different labels.
